# Capstone
Spring 2021 Capstone Project

This Github repository contains data files and webscraping python scripts used in my capstone project.

The goal of my project was to create a dataset of black film that can be used for analysis of fiscal trends in black film. It includes the estimated budget, domestic and worldwide box office numbers for over 700 American black films. I defined black films as those that centered on African American stories and African American characters, or were made by Black filmmakers. I also included movies embraced by African American audiences that were made by non-Black filmmakers like Bad Boys, Django Unchained, and The Color Purple. I used a combination of Box Office Mojo, The Black Cinema Database, Rotten Tomatoes, and the Blackclassiclmovies.com database to create my dataset. 


Users will need to have the following installed before cloning the github repository:
Python 3.9 application 
Text editor that can run python code. I used VS Code.

After downloading python 3.9 you can use pip Python package manager to install the packages I used in this project (pandas, beautifulsoup, etc.).
